Ok so we can have waypoints that belong to an aircraft. and what it will do is calculate distance to waypoint 2 and if it has exceded the distance
between those way points, it will calculate the next one and the next one until it gets the right segment then calculates the bearing. if greater than the distance between first and last waypoint then the bearing between the last two way points is the bearing it continues along

todo
test to create aircraft for testing then verify the aircraft exist ( but how to do it so it doesn't touch aircraft file or how to restore original aircraft file afterwards). 

to have a formation of two fighters
you can have a flag to put a ghost one on there that stays at 235 or 135 from the bearing 300 meters or 400 meters distancek. 

how to do race track with major minor
how to do circular orbits

maybe orbit type is path, racetrack, orbit

Added US cities.csv
waypoint: lat,long
waypoint: zipcode
waypoint: City,ST


implement waypoints, measuring distance to first if calculated distanced flown is greater, measure distance second to third etc

for orbit, calculate 100 waypoints around the point, modulos to figure out where between it should fall, when it gets to last point go to first point and when it hits first point maybe it resets the time? i don't know there's a way to do this though and i'm close
