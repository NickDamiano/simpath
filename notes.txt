Flask Server that simulates aircraft movement from point a to point b to point c

database holds
aircraft object
current_lat
current_long
2nd_lat
2nd_long
3rd_lat
3rd_long
altitude
speed
last reported position
bearing?
type
group?

perhaps there is a database with aircraft_type?
so F16, F18, F22, etc they all have speeds prebuilt for cruising speed

there can be groups

maybe what it does is figure out the lat long by calculating last reported position + bearing * speed
perhaps the destination lat longs can be set by a zip code


api 
create object 



Ok so we can have waypoints that belong to an aircraft. and what it will do is calculate distance to waypoint 2 and if time is greater

todo
Create the endpoint to add 1 or more aircraft
Use that to create aircraft for testing then verify the aircraft exist ( but how to do it so it doesn't touch aircraft file or how to restore original aircraft file afterwards)

to have a formation of two fighters
you can have a flag to put a ghost one on there that stays at 235 or 135 from the bearing 300 meters or 400 meters distancek
